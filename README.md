My first ever Java game.

# Big Bois The Game for Desktop Info

## What are the differences between the desktop and mobile versions?
All of the differences are outlined in the Android update log.

## Which version of the game is the main version?
It used to be the desktop version for a while. However, the Android version currently has a bit more development done and contains some features that the desktop version does not have. Also the Android version is alot more appealing to the eye than the desktop version as well.

## Will you continue to develop the desktop version?
Most likely not, as said in the other readme, Big Bois The Game is mainly a learning experience rather than a passion project. I felt like everything I wanted to do with the desktop version has been achieved, and the Android version is just better now that I know Android development. Also the entire project is a single class which accurately relays my naievity whilst writing this game. Finally, the Android version, as an APK, is just easier to distribute, and it can be played on the go, it is the much superior version.

## What is the purpose of having both versions in this repo, but only anticipating on developing one?
Well you never know, I may develop for both, just one, or neither. Simply put, this repo is mainly for organization and documentation purposes.

## How can I play this game?
You can download the .jar on pretty much any operating system that has Java properly installed, and run it as an executable. The game was properly tested on Windows and macOSX, I haven't tested it on Linux, however I would imagine that it does work becasue of the JVM.
